# Outline

- Introduction
- Generalized linear models
- Getting ready for the lab

# Overview

## Regression models

- Most commonly used to assess presence of a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- Bayesian regression originally used in econometrics.
- Now wide range of fields use regression, including environmental epidemiology.
- That's why we find ourselves here today!

## Regression models

- Basic steps to regression models:
- 1. Estbalish suitable probability distribution for observations.
- 2. Identify type of relationship between predictor(s) and outcome.
- <span style="color:red;">3. For Bayesian approach, specify prior distributions too</span>.

## Linear regression

- Simplest regression model.
- Assuming a linear relationship between predictors and the outcome.
- Used in countless different applications.

## Normal distribution

- Description of characteristics of normal distribution.

## Linear regression

- Each outcome $y_i$ is normally distributed as follows:
- $$y_i \sim Normal(\mu_i,\sigma^2)$$
- Remember what these symbols all mean?

## Link function

- When modelling, we must make a decision about how the predictors are related to the key parameters in our chosen relationship
- You will see several of the remaining time in the workshop.

## Back to linear regression

- Assuming we just express $\mu_i$ as a linear function of parameters of interest
- $$\mu_i = ...$$

## Setting priors

- Need to do this on:
- The regression parameters (i.e., the $\Beta$ parameters).
- Variance of outcome ($\sigma^2$).

## Setting priors

- In absence of information, set priors as vague:
- [[[beta priors]]]
- [[[sigma prior]]]

## Linear regression

- In NIMBLE, we can write:

``` R
model(
  # prior
  alpha ~ dnorm(0, pow(10, -2))
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 100)
  tau <- pow(sigma, -2) # precision
  for (k in 1:p) beta[k] ~ dnorm(0, 1)

  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:n) {
    y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
    mu[i] <- alpha + inprod(beta[1:p], x[i, 1:p])
  }
)
```

## Linear regression: Real world example

- A preview of lab (something from UK/Italy dataset)

## Evaluating model fit

- Sometimes a seemingly reasonable approach can result in unexpected results.
- When this happens (and in general), good idea to have some way to evaluate model fit of candidate models.
- Ideally residuals after model fit are essentially random centered around zero.

## Non-linear regression

- Seasonality can exist in data, for example, that requires accounting for.

## Non-linear regression

- Also, there can be autocorrelation between neighboring time points.

## Non-linear regression: Real world example

- A preview of lab (something from UK/Italy dataset but progression from linear)

# Genrealized linear models

## Exponential family of models

- Sometimes dependent variable is not normally distributed.
- Exponential family is family of models described in a certain way (won't get into it in this workshop):
- $$ XX $$

## Generalized linear models

- Extension of linear regression to when distribution not necessarily normally distributed.
- Distributions which are part of the exponential family can describe all sort of non-normally distributed variables.
- Many examples commonly encountered in environmental health.
- We'll go through a few now...

## Logistic regression

- Part of exponential family.
- Standard for binary outcomes (yes/no).
- Many examples in environmental health, such as whether a person died.

## Logistic regression

- If dependent variable represents individual units:
- Distributed with Bernoulli (only zero or one).

## Logistic regression

- If dependent variable represents sets of trails of yes/no:
- Distributed with Binomial (zero to $n$ successes).

## Link function

::: nonincremental
- When modelling, we must make a decision about how the predictors are related to the key parameters in our chosen relationship
- You will see several of the remaining time in the workshop.
:::

## Link function fo logistic regression

- Binomial formula.
- Link function on $pi$ is $logit$ (ln(p/1-p)). (log odds).

## Logistic regression: Real world example

- A preview of lab (something from UK/Italy dataset but progression from linear (mortality?))

## Poisson regression

- Part of exponential family.
- Used typically with count data (number of events happening within a discrete space and time).
- Can approximate to Binomial for high n and low p.

## Link function

::: nonincremental
- When modelling, we must make a decision about how the predictors are related to the key parameters in our chosen relationship
- You will see several of the remaining time in the workshop.
:::

## Link function fo logistic regression

- Poisson formula.
- Link function on log link (ensures counts don't ever become negative).

# Getting ready for the lab

## The lab for this session

- In this session, we are going to go through examples usuing NIMBLE with the following:
- Linear regression.
- Non-linear regression.
- Logistic regression.
- Poisson regression.
