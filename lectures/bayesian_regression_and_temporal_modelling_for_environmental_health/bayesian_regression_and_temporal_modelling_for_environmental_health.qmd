# Outline

- Introduction
- Generalized linear models
- Getting ready for the lab

# Overview

## Regression models

- Most commonly used to assess presence of a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- Bayesian regression originally used in econometrics.
- Now wide range of fields use regression, including environmental epidemiology.

## Linear regression

## Linear regression: example

## Non-linear regression

## Non-linear regression: example

# Genrealized linear models

## Exponential family of models

- XX

## Generalized linear models

- Extension of linear regression to when distribution not necessarily normally distributed.
- Still part of exponential family
- XX

## Logistic regression

## Logistic regression: example

## Poisson regression

## Poisson regression: example

# Getting ready for the lab

## The lab for this session
