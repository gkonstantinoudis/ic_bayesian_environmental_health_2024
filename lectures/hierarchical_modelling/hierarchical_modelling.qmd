* Data can have several types of structure. Including nestedness, which we call “hierarchical”.

* hierarchical models: nested models, multi-level models

* pooled model: ignore the grouping structure
- important information is neglected

* unpooled: model each group separately
— many distinct groups
— some groups have small sample size

* partial pooling, hierarchical modeli
— complexity
