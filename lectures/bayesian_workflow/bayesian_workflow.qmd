- show Bayes formula again. “What can possibly go wrong?”

- general principle while using a PPLs: focus on modelling, use diagnostic tools

- diagnosing MCMC outputs: R-hat, trace-plots, ESS

- what is a workflow? Box’s loop, modern Bayesian workflow

- iterative model building: understand the domain, formulate the problem mathematically, implement the model, test, debug

- prior predictive check, fit the model, assess convergence, posterior predictive, iterate

- SBC

- example: SIR

- example: GP

- conclusion

- references
