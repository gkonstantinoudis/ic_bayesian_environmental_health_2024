## Overview of workshop {.bigger}

::: {style="font-size: 130%;"}
The __Quantifying the impact of the environment on health using Bayesian methods__ course is  a two-day course adapted from the __SHARP Workshop__ given at Columbia.  It consists of seminars and hands-on analytical sessions to provide an _approachable_ and _practical_ overview of __concepts__, __techniques__, and __data analysis methods__ used in Bayesian modelling with applications in Environmental Health.

## What is your experience level with R? {.smaller}

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- the middle 95 range of values you would get had the experiment been repeated in the exact same condition 100 times. So the extreme values you might expect to fall outside purely by chance
- Assuming CI=confidence interval, if I randomly sample from a population 100 times and calculate the mean and SE for each draw, 95% of those computed intervals will include the true population mean.
- Confidence in having attained correct results is 95% (meaning a 5% chance of being incorrect); also indicates stability or repeatability of results
- If we were to take many samples from the population and compute a 95% confidence interval from each of them the same way, we would expect about 95% of the intervals to contain the true parameter value
- If the 95% CI crosses the null, then your association is not statistically significant.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- 95% of random iterations wherein parameter of interest falls within specified range
- 95% of 95%CIs will upon replication include the true population parameter
- There is 5% chance of being wrong or making the wrong assumption.
- If 100 CIs are created, 95 of the 100 will cover the true value
- The range of values between which the "true" answer lies 95% of the time if you ran an experient over and over again.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- That there is a 95% probability that the result contains a true parameter when drawing from a random sample repeatedly.
- 95% percent of the time the estimate will fall within this range of 95% CI.
- I am 95% confident that the population parameters is in this confidence interval
- A statistic of uncertainty around the mean measurement.
- The result is 95% true.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- The true value is 95% likely to be within the upper and lower CI limits
- If we take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each sample, we would expect approximately 95 of the 100 confidence intervals to contain the true population parameter.
- There is a 5% chance that the true value lies outside of the given range.
- Determines the precision and accuracy of model predictions (larger CI means less precision, too small is potential overfitting, etc.)
- 95 times out of 100 the true estimate will lie within this interval

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)? {.smaller}

- Frequentist framework: If we were to repeat the data collection process 100 times and construct confidence intervals for each sample, 95 of those would contain the true parameter (i.e., the target parameter is fixed but unknown, and the interval is random, in other words, there exists a true value of the target parameter, and we may or may not be capturing it with the 95% CI).
- Bayesian framework: Given the observed data and our prior beliefs, there is a 95% probability that the true parameter value falls within the credible interval (i.e., target parameter is random but interval is fixed).
- Philosophical difference but with differences in methodology and use cases.

<!-- - Frequentist framework: “There is an 95% probability that when computing a confidence interval from data of this sort, the effect falls within this range”. -->
<!-- - Bayesian framework allows us to say “given the observed data, the effect has 95% probability of falling within this range”. -->
