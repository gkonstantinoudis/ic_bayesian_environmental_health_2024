## What does a 50% chance of rain mean to you? {.smaller}

- given the data used to generate prediction, there is equal likelihood of raining and not raining. Also it means I’ll be bringing my umbrella.
- I am definitely not a meteorologist but our snow forecasters tell us its a combination of % described catchment area and confidence that any given area in that catchment will receive precipitation
- There is a 50% chance that rain will occur in the allotted time period
- I'm not a meteorologist, but I assume it means there is a 50% likelihood that any location within the forecast area will experience rain during the forecast period. It might also mean that rain will cover 50% of the forecasted region/area.
- If you were to stay in one location, there is a 50% likelihood that you will experience rain. If you were to travel around local areas, 50% of those areas will likely experience rain.

## What does a 50% chance of rain mean to you? {.smaller}

- based on previous data with similar starting weather conditions, 50% of those instances resulted in rain
- Have not actually given it too much thought before. Beyond it being just as likely to rain and not rain... I think it means that there is 100% chance that 50% of the area covered will get rain or for 100% of the area considered, 50% chance there will be rain? Combination of area covered and predicted likelihood, I think?
- There is a 0.5 probability that it will rain.
- 50% of locations in a predicted area will rain (?)
- In the area where the forecast model is being run, 50% of the pixels are predicted to experience rain.

## What does a 50% chance of rain mean to you? {.smaller}

- That it is equally likely to rain as it is to not rain.
- 50% of the time it will rain and 50% of the time it will not.
- there is an equal likelihood of rain occurring or not occurring
- 1 out 2 chance that it will rain.
- There is a 50% chance it will rain.

## What does a 50% chance of rain mean to you? {.smaller}

- There is a 50% chance of rain occurring in the reporting area
- a 50 percent chance for any one spot in the forecast area to get wet during the forecast period
- For the region, there is a half and half chance that some point within the area will see rain.
- 50/100 days with the same or similar conditions had rain, which means that today there is a 50/100 chance of there being any rain
- There is an equal chance that it will rain versus not rain

## What does a 50% chance of rain mean to you? {.smaller}

- Met Office (UK): A 50% chance of rain represents a 5 in 10 chance that rain will fall at some point during that period.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- the middle 95 range of values you would get had the experiment been repeated in the exact same condition 100 times. So the extreme values you might expect to fall outside purely by chance
- Assuming CI=confidence interval, if I randomly sample from a population 100 times and calculate the mean and SE for each draw, 95% of those computed intervals will include the true population mean.
- Confidence in having attained correct results is 95% (meaning a 5% chance of being incorrect); also indicates stability or repeatability of results
- If we were to take many samples from the population and compute a 95% confidence interval from each of them the same way, we would expect about 95% of the intervals to contain the true parameter value
- If the 95% CI crosses the null, then your association is not statistically significant.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- 95% of random iterations wherein parameter of interest falls within specified range
- 95% of 95%CIs will upon replication include the true population parameter
- There is 5% chance of being wrong or making the wrong assumption.
- If 100 CIs are created, 95 of the 100 will cover the true value
- The range of values between which the "true" answer lies 95% of the time if you ran an experient over and over again.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- That there is a 95% probability that the result contains a true parameter when drawing from a random sample repeatedly.
- 95% percent of the time the estimate will fall within this range of 95% CI.
- I am 95% confident that the population parameters is in this confidence interval
- A statistic of uncertainty around the mean measurement.
- The result is 95% true.

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)?{.smaller}

- The true value is 95% likely to be within the upper and lower CI limits
- If we take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each sample, we would expect approximately 95 of the 100 confidence intervals to contain the true population parameter.
- There is a 5% chance that the true value lies outside of the given range.
- Determines the precision and accuracy of model predictions (larger CI means less precision, too small is potential overfitting, etc.)
- 95 times out of 100 the true estimate will lie within this interval

## What do you understand from a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)? {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Frequentist framework: If we were to repeat the data collection process 100 times and construct confidence intervals for each sample, 95 of those would contain the true parameter (i.e., the target parameter is fixed but unknown, and the interval is random, in other words, there exists a true value of the target parameter, and we may or may not be capturing it with the 95% CI).
- Bayesian framework: Given the observed data and our prior beliefs, there is a 95% probability that the true parameter value falls within the credible interval (i.e., target parameter is random but interval is fixed).
- Philosophical difference but with differences in methodology and use cases.
:::

<!-- - Frequentist framework: “There is an 95% probability that when computing a confidence interval from data of this sort, the effect falls within this range”. -->
<!-- - Bayesian framework allows us to say “given the observed data, the effect has 95% probability of falling within this range”. -->
